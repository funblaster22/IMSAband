    <p>The Eleventy ecosystem is <em>huge</em>! There are <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/">official and community</a> starters for almost any glitch project you can dream up.</p>
<p>The best part is, no matter what starter you use, as long as you set your eleventy app to <em>generated static site</em>, you'll be able to take advantage of the feature on Glitch! (someone plz rewrite this)</p>
<p>https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/ - also there are plugins, you could put them into this project</p>
<p>Some next steps you could consider in this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a UI library like tailwind</li>
<li>Use the eleventy image library to optimize your blog images</li>
</ul>
