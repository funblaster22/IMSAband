    <p>Congrats! You've launched a beautiful new Eleventy-powered blog on Glitch. Want to see what makes creating on Glitch magical? Check it out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, your site is <strong>live on the web</strong>, with a real URL (a secure HTTPS address!) that updates as soon as you make changes to your site or app.
<ul>
<li><strong>Try this</strong>: In the Glitch editor, click on the name of your project, and in the menu that opens, select the name of your project and type a new one. Your project will be live at the new address instantly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Add a domain</strong> to your new Glitch project! Just go to the <strong>Tools</strong> menu in the Glitch editor, and click on &quot;Custom Domains&quot;</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Share</strong> button in the Glitch editor to invite others in to edit your new Eleventy project by typing in their email or their Glitch username
<ul>
<li><strong>Try this</strong>: Make your code, or even your entire app, private to just those you invite, just by <a href="https://glitch.com/pricing">upgrading your Glitch account</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a <strong>full-powered Linux command line</strong> to manage your new Glitch project. Go to the <strong>Tools</strong> menu in the Glitch editor, and click &quot;Terminal&quot; to peek under the hood.</li>
</ul>
