    <p>This is a standard Eleventy blog post, written entirely in Markdown. (Don't know Markdown? Here are <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">some tips</a>.) With Glitch, you can edit Markdown right in the editor, and this page will update as you type.</p>
<p>Want to switch between editing Markdown and seeing a preview of your formatted text? Click on the &quot;Markdown&quot; button just above this editor window.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try this</strong>: Are the live updates to your site distracting you while you write or work? Go to the project menu in the top-left of your Glitch editor, and uncheck the box for &quot;Refresh App on Changes&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Post Metadata</h3>
<p>In addition to the text of your blog post, there's some metadata that tells Eleventy about things like the title and date of your post. That's stored in a &quot;front matter block&quot; at the top of the markdown file, which looks like this. You'll figure it out, no problem.</p>
