Hooray! IMSA bands now have their own website! Thanks to a [collaboration between students]({{ '/pages/about/#student-credits' | url }}), the new site
is now up and running! The code is even [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
under the [GPL v3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html),  so any IMSA student can take a look and improve it!
The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/funblaster22/IMSAband), a collaboration platform.
Here are some things you need to know to get up and running:

### Overview of technologies
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) (*.njk), a templating language
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/), a UI component library
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) (*.md), an easily readable markup language
