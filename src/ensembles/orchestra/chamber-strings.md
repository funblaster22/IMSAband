The Chamber Strings will explore the music of different composers via analysis, rehearsal and performance. This exploration will
provide students with an overview of the visual, auditory and aesthetic dimensions of instrumental music. Particular attention will be paid
to ensemble participation in the context of rehearsal and performance. Students will develop further technical proficiency and enhance
their musical understanding through problem-based learning, sight-reading exercises, tone development and intonation exercises, critical
thinking skills, reflection, analysis and practice. Students will perform in formal concerts as well as have the opportunity to audition
for and participate in the IHSA Solo/Ensemble Contest and in the ILMEA District and All-State Festivals. Private lessons are highly
recommended. Student participation in the Chamber Strings is based upon a placement audition. This group is primarily comprised
of upper classmen, and only 3-5% of the ensemble includes sophomores. Students from this ensemble will also perform with the
Symphony Orchestra. Students will perform advanced orchestral literature and original transcriptions. Students enrolled in the IMSA
Music Program are eligible to participate in any music sponsored co-curricular activities and/or events.
