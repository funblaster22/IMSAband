Jazz Ensemble aims to increase interest in Jazz Music across the IMSA community by fielding a performing ensemble for events such as Casa and Harambe, and hosting events on jazz history, improvisation and other topics. Our audience is the entire IMSA community, though participation in performing ensembles is mainly directed at instrumentalists who love playing jazz music. We tend to meet once or multiple times a week during the lead up to a performance or event, and we always love to get music recommendations!
