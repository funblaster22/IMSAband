The Wind Ensemble will explore the music of different composers via analysis, rehearsal and performance. This exploration will provide
students with an overview of the visual, auditory and aesthetic dimensions of instrumental music. Particular attention will be paid to
ensemble participation in the context of rehearsal and performance. Students will develop further technical proficiency and enhance
their musical understanding through problem-based learning, sight-reading exercises, tone development and intonation exercises, critical
thinking skills, reflection, analysis and practice. Students will perform in formal concerts as well as have the opportunity to audition for
and participate in the IHSA Solo/Ensemble Contest and in the ILMEA District and All-State Festivals. Students will also perform with
Pep Band. Private lessons are highly recommended. Student participation in the Wind Ensemble is based upon a placement audition.
This group is primarily comprised of upper classmen, and only 3-5% of the ensemble includes sophomores. Students will perform
advanced band literature and original transcriptions. The top students from each section will perform with the Symphony Orchestra.
Students enrolled in the IMSA Music Program are eligible to participate in any music sponsored co-curricular activities and/or events.
