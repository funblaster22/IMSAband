The Concert Band will explore the music of different composers via analysis, rehearsal and performance. This exploration will provide
students with an overview of the visual, auditory and aesthetic dimensions of instrumental music. Particular attention will be paid
to ensemble participation in the context of rehearsal and performance. Students will develop further technical proficiency and enhance
their musical understanding through problem-based learning, sight-reading exercises, tone development and intonation exercises, critical
thinking skills, reflection, analysis and practice. Students will perform in formal concerts as well as have the opportunity to audition
for and participate in the IHSA Solo/Ensemble Contest and in the ILMEA District and All-State festivals. Students will also perform
with Pep Band. Private lessons are highly recommended. Music students are eligible to participate in any music sponsored co-curricular
activities and/or events.
