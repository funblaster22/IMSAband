A band is typically comprised of all the non-string instruments, like the flute, clarinet, oboe, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, tuba, and percussion.
IMSA has two levels of band, _Concert Band_ and _Wind Ensemble_. The former accepts all students, while the latter requires an audition to get in.

### Pep Band
All and students are required to participate in the [pep band]({{ '/posts/pep-band' | url }}), which plays at varsity basketball games.
