Solo and Ensemble is a competition where students learn and play either a solo or ensemble piece to preform for a panel
of judges, who will then rank the performance on a variety of factors such as rhythm, tone quality, and dynamics, among others.
If you're a student interested in participating, see the [IHSA's website](https://www.ihsa.org/Sports-Activities/Music).
