The upcoming school senior concert is a celebration of the hard work and achievements of our graduating seniors. The concert will feature musical performances from some of the most talented seniors, making it a night to remember as they say goodbye to their high school years and embrace the next chapter of their lives. Some of our student composers will also have the opportunity to debut a piece they've written, while others will be conducting their class in a piece.
